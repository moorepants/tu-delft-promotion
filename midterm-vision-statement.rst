Introduction
============

I joined Delft University of Technology as an assistant professor on August 1,
2020 following five years as an Assistant Professor of Teaching at the
University of California, Davis (UCD). I came to TU Delft (TUD) to pursue my
dream of researching bicycle engineering and teaching engineering dynamics. Due
to The Netherland's unique appreciation for bicycling and TU Delft students'
being known as the fietsenmakers, this may be the only place in the world where
this could come true. The joy of engineering drives me and I desire to pass
that feeling on to my students and colleagues through my education, research,
and service activities.

Research
========

Societies around the globe must vastly increase bicycle use to reduce
transportation energy usage, reduce pollution and global warming, improve the
health of society, and increase happiness. The Netherlands leads all other
countries, by a large margin, in bicycle transportation mode share (27%), yet
we are also a heavily car dependent nation with no growth in bicycling for
decades now. Most other countries have dismal bicycle use and developing
countries are following in wrong footsteps of North America and Europe. Most
car trips are under 15 km and, with bicycling being the most energy efficient
mode of human transport, these distances are accessible by bike. Stated simply,
these car trips have to be changed to bicycling for our best transportation
future. I intend to play a role in that change through advancing bicycle
engineering.

Bicycle transportation research has skyrocketed in the last 20 years and TU
Delft has the world's only significant and well supported `bicycle engineering
laboratory`_, which I now lead. My vision is to make significant contributions to
the wider adoption of bicycling around the world by understanding how people
interact with the bicycle and the transportation environment. My mechanical and
biomechanical foundation begins with understanding of the bicycle-rider dynamic
system, which I categorize into four fundamental research areas: 1) vehicle
dynamics, 2) rider biomechanics, 3) rider neuromuscular control, and 4)
bicycle-rider behavior.

I have developed a number of bicycle-rider dynamics models which I am now
extending with the muscle actuated steering. I will combine these models with
my rider control identification techniques to further define the essential
neuromuscular control sensor-actuation pathways. With these physics-informed
data driven models I will be able to predict the bicyclist's behavior in safety
and performance critical transportation scenarios. The insights will allow us
to design the vehicle with desired dynamics, make it adapt to the rider through
assistive robotics, and to help shape our transportation infrastructure to
complement and interact with the bicycle of the future.

As far as I know, I am the only researcher that is approaching the innovations
in bicycling from this merger of vehicle dynamics and rider biomechanical
control. I believe it will produce unique and valuable insights for vehicle
designers, infrastructure designers, urban planners, and those that study human
traffic behavior. These insights will help us create a future where we
drastically increase bicycle use around the globe.

Valorization
============

I would like to see TU Delft be the world's hub for bicycle engineering
research and for us to broadly support society's needs for innovations in
bicycle technology. In my brief time here, I have worked to establish and
engage a growing network of bicycle interested industry partners. I currently
work in close partnership with Royal Dutch Gazelle, Team DSM, and Bosch eBike
Systems as part of an NWO Perspectief grant and have been developing
relationships with SWOV, TeamNL (BMX), Tacx by Garmin, Specialized, Trek, and
Shimano. I am hosting the `2023 Bicycle and Motorcycle Dynamics Conference`_ in
Delft which will bring together an international community of experts in
academia and industry and expand TU Delft's connections to this field.

.. _2023 Bicycle and Motorcycle Dynamics Conference: https://2023.bmdconf.org

I was awarded a Chan-Zuckerberg Essential Open Source Software for Science
grant (350k EUR) with partners SymPy, Quantsight, and the University of Bristol
to build out the rider biomechanical modeling capabilities mentioned above. I
followed this with a 3mE cohesion grant (200k EUR) in collaboration with Azita
Dabiri (DCSC), Frederik Schulte (Maritime), and Riender Happee (CoR) to expand
the use of the bicycle-rider models into micro traffic simulation. We will test
the ideas of sharing information among connected bicycles and automated
vehicles for enhanced safety. We see this leading to future proposals and
collaborations with transportation engineering/planning firms and smart vehicle
companies.

Lastly, in the short term I hope to begin creating a research consortium of
bicycle companies and TU Delft researchers with the intent to identify common
research needs across industry which we can tackle for broad benefit.

Education
=========

As a driving theme, I want to further and apply the concepts of "computational
thinking" in my educational activities. Computational thinking can be defined
as the *thought processes involved in formulating problems so their solutions
can be represented as computational steps and algorithms* (Wikipeida 2023).
Reasoning through computational thinking provides learners a complementary
learning tool on par with natural language, visualizations, and mathematics. To
that end, I have developed three BSc (UCD) and three MSc courses (1 at UCD & 2
at TUD) where I have either built them entirely on the principals of
computational thinking or heavily woven it in. For example, in courses I may
lead the students in live coding exercises to explore and understand a new
dynamics concept. I have taught these six course fourteen times to
approximately 800 students.

   EME 134, 2 times, 40 students
   EME 171, 3 times, 60 students
   ENG 122, 3 times, 25 students
   MAE 223, 2 times, 20 students
   ME41035, 2 times, 20 students
   ME41055, 2 times, 200 students

Here at TU Delft, I am currently developing and teaching two Master of Science
courses: "`Multibody Dynamics B`_", a Mechanical Engineering track core course,
and "`Special Topics in Sports Engineering`_", an elective. Mulibody Dynamics
serves 200 students per year and Special Topics provides a two week 3 ECTS
summer course for about 30 students per year from around The Netherlands and
Europe.

.. _Special Topics in Sports Engineering: https://moorepants.github.io/me41035/
.. _Multibody Dynamics B: https://moorepants.github.io/me41055/

In Multibody Dynamics, I make use of active learning practices by providing a
series of lecture videos paired with in-person guided homework work sessions. I
wrote a 300 page open access online interactive computational oriented book,
`Learn Multibody Dynamics`_, for the course which is paired with a set of 12
computational homeworks including conceptual questions the students complete
each week as an optional portion of the final grade and to gain formative
feedback for the exam preparation.

.. _Learn Multibody Dynamics: https://moorepants.github.io/learn-multibody-dynamics/

Special Topics in Sports Engineering challenges internationally mixed student
groups to develop a computational predictive model for a cycling time trial
based on a series of interdisciplinary lectures assembled from sports
engineering experts around Europe and paired with a series of student designed
experiments to develop the principles of mechanics, data analyses, computation,
and physiology to strengthen their models. This course is a key offering for
our Sports Engineering MSc designation.

I have received personal positive feedback from students on on the pedagogical
approaches of both courses, with particular appreciation of being able to solve
realistic problems at the course's end. The number of students in Multibdoy
Dynamics B has increased from 160 to 210 since last year. I see multibody
dynamics remaining an important foundational course for our MSc tracks that
need to model and simulate robotics, vehicles, mechanisms, musculoskeletal
systems, etc. I hope to transform Special Topics in Sports Engineering into a
full blown bicycle engineering course, unique in the world, and increase the
number of students served by this hands-on approach to learning.

Organization Contributions
==========================

I currently serve on the Mechanical Engineering MSc Opleiding Commissie to help
provide feedback on curriculum improvements and address concerns from the
student organizations. I have participated in developing the updates to the 3mE
literature study rubric, provided materials to assist in developing the BME/BMD
MSc track guidance documents, and contributed to the department's accreditation
reporting process. Our department is working on growth and change and I chair
the transparency working group in that process. At the university level, I am
part of Delft Open Science, helping promote best practices, and work with the
library to pilot their open peer review journal publishing model.

Leadership
==========

I firmly believe that a good leader focuses on the people they are leading
first and foremost. Building trust, camaraderie, equity, and joy in our shared
work sets the foundation to excel at our jobs and studies. I lead a research
group centered around the bicycle lab where I work work to foster an inclusive
and participatory environment. I have established regular lab meetings, an
onboarding process for students and staff alike, a collaboratively developed
lab guide, social events for our team, and a culture of collective team work
and shared responsibilities. My goal is to empower everyone involved in our
research and educational activities to take ownership and collectively drive
our mission while also meeting their personal goals.

Conclusion
==========

With the heavy effects of coronavirus now over a year past, I believe I have
established a strong foundation for success here at TU Delft. I intend to
target an NWO Open Technology Program to take the traffic simulation modeling
cohesion project outside of the simulation environment and into a living lab.
My work with safety in sports will be expanded at the international level,
where I will target Horizon Europe opportunities in health and leverage my
international collaborations. On the education front, I want to formally
publish my multibody dynamics book and then help others develop similar
teaching approaches and materials. Lastly, I want to have a lot of fun working
on challenging research with my group and collaborators so that we can make the
world better with more bicycles and more people riding them.
