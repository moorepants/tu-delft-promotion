Introduction
============

I joined Delft University of Technology as an assistant professor on August 1,
2020 following five years as an Assistant Professor of Teaching at the
University of California, Davis. I came to TU Delft to pursue my dream of
researching bicycle engineering and teaching engineering dynamics. Due to The
Netherland's unique appreciation for bicycles, this may be the only place in
the world where this path could come true. The joy of engineering drives me and
I desire to pass that feeling on to my students and colleagues through my
education, research, and service activities.

Education
=========

As a driving theme, I want to further and apply the concepts of "computational
thinking" in my educational activities. Computational thinking can be defined
as the *thought processes involved in formulating problems so their solutions
can be represented as computational steps and algorithms* (Wikipeida 2023).
Reasoning through computational thinking provides learners a complementary
learning tool on par wth natural language, visualizations, and mathematics. To
that end, I have developed three BSc (UCD) and three MSc courses (1 at UCD & 2
at TUD) where I have either built them entirely on the principals of
computational thinking or heavily woven it in. I have taught these six course
fourteen times to approximately 800 students.

   EME 134, 2 times, 40 students
   EME 171, 3 times, 60 students
   ENG 122, 3 times, 25 students
   MAE 223, 2 times, 20 students
   ME41035, 2 times, 20 students
   ME41055, 2 times, 200 students

Here at TU Delft, I am currently developing and teaching two Master of Science
courses: "`Special Topics in Sports Engineering`_", an elective, and
"`Multibody Dynamics B`_", a Mechanical Engineering track core course. Mulibody
Dynamics serves 200 students per year and Special Topics provides a two week
for credit summer course for about 30 students from around the Netherlands and
Europe.

.. _Multibody Dynamics B: https://moorepants.github.io/me41055/

In Multibody Dynamics, I have flipped the course providing as series of lecture
videos paired with in-person guided homework work sessions. I wrote a 300 page
open access online inerative computational oriented book, `Learn Multibody
Dynamics`_ for the course which is paired with a set of 12 computational
homeworks including conceptual questions the students complete each week as an
optional portion of the final grade and to gain formative feedback for the exam
preparation.

Special Topics in Sports Engineering challenges internationally mixed student
groups to develop a computational predictive model for a cycling time trial
based on a series of interdisciplinary lectures assembled from sports
engineering experts around Europe and paired with a series of student designed
experiments to develop the principles of mechanics, data analyses, computation,
and physiology of their models. This course is a key offering for our Sports
Engineering track certificate.

I see the multibody dynamics course remaining an important course for a number
of our MSc tracks that need a solid foundation in modeling and simulating
multibody dynamics in robotics, vehicles, musculoskeletal systems, etc. I hope
to transform Special Topics into a full blown bicycle engineering course,
unique in the world, and increase the number of students served by this hands
on approach to learning.

Research
========

Societies around the globe must vastly replace the number of trips taken by car
with trips taken by bicycle to reduce transportation energy usage, reduce
pollution and global warming, improve the health of society, and increase
happiness. The Netherlands leads all other countries, by a large margin, in
bicycle transportation mode share (27%), yet we are also still a heavily car
dependent nation that has had this mode share for decades with no growth in
bicycling. Most other countries have dismal bicycle use and developing
countries are following in wrong footsteps of North America and Europe's car
use. Bicycling is the most energy efficient mode of transport and most car
trips are under 15 km. Stated simply, these trips have to be changed to
bicycling for the best transportation future. As an American resident of the
Netherlands, I have a dual perspective of experience in one of the worst
developed countries for bicycling and the best that places me in a unique
position to help with global and national solutions in this space.

Bicycle transportation research has skyrocketed in the last 20 years and TU
Delft has the world's only significant and well supported bicycle engineering
laboratory, which I now lead. My vision is to make significant contributions
to the wider adoption of bicycling around the world by understanding how
bicyclists interact with the bicycle and the transportation environment. My
mechanical and biomechanical foundation begins with understanding of the
bicycle-rider dynamic system, which I categorize into four fundamental research
areas: 1) vehicle dynamics, 2) rider biomechanics, 3) rider neuromuscular
control, and 4) bicycle-rider behavior. I will use these fundamental pillars to
develop innovations for the vehicle that will make the bicycle the most
attractive mode of transport for the 21st century.

My unique strength is the combination of these four pillars. I am the only
researcher that is developing the theory of the rider's neuromuscular control
and using it to predict a bicyclist's behavior in the natural transportation
system. I use a balanced combination of first principles modeling that are
driven by data generated from carefully designed experiments.

Valorization
============

My long term goal is to make TU Delft the world's hub for bicycle engineering
research and to broadly support society's needs for innovations in bicycle
technology. I currently work in close partnership with Royal Dutch Gazelle and
Bosch eBike Systems, Team DSM, ICTech, and Prinoth. I have been developing
relationships with SWOV, TeamNL (BMX), Tacx by Garmin, TrueKinetix, Swugo,
Specialized, Trek, and Shimano. I have worked with World Bicycle Relief (SRAM)
and numerous startups (Swugo, TrueKinetix, ICTech, German group). My short term
goal is to create a research consortium of bicycle companies and TU Delft
researchers with the intent to identify common research needs across companies
which we can tackle for broad benefit to the industry.

Contributions to the Organization
=================================

Besides my intention to support computational thinking across the university, I
serve on the Mechanical Engineering Olieding Comissie. I am part of the BMechE
committee for our accreditation. I also am part of Delft Open Science Help the
library pilot new publishing methods. Recess College

Vision on Leadership
====================

I firmly believe that a good leader focuses on the people they are leading
first and foremost. Building trust, camaraderie, equity, and joy in our shared
work sets the foundation to excel at what we do. I lead a research group
centered around the Bicycle Lab and play a leadership role in my broader
research community through conference, symposia, and workshop organization.
Being still relatively new at TU Delft, I have not yet taken on significant
leadership roles but that will come as I become more integrated and connected.

Developments in my field of study, position within it, and plans for the future

TODO, or have I done this above?
