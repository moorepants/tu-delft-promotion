Introduction
============

This repository contains materials and information regarding my academic
promotion process at Delft University of Technology since I began there as an
assistant professor (UD2, salary scale 11-6) on August 1, 2020. This follows a
similar repository I shared for the promotion process for my Assistant
Professor of Teaching position at the University of California, Davis from
2015-2020: https://github.com/moorepants/lpsoe-merit-and-tenure. I share these
materials to be transparent and to possibly help or inform others going through
the same or similar processes.

I began on the "Tenure Track" process which was introduced at the 3mE faculty
sometime in the 2010s. This process followed a more traditional Dutch academic
process before that where you could possibly be promoted from Universitair
docent -> Universitair hoofddocent -> Hoogleraar (which are still technically
our titles in the new process). I switched to the "Academic Career Track"
process in mid-2023 as the prior process is being abandoned, see below.

Process Explanation
===================

Tenure Track
   You begin with a temporary contract of 6 years which can be made permanent
   by granting you "tenure" by the end of the 5th year. After about 2.5 to 3
   years as an assistant professor you write a vision statement and make a
   presentation in front of a midterm evaluation committee. The committee is
   made up of the faculty's director of education, your immediate supervisor (a
   full professor), the department manager, and three full professors from other
   departments in the faculty. This committee provides a written letter
   informing you if you are on track for the tenure process, what things to
   work on for improvement, and possibly a recommendation of when you may want
   to consider requesting for tenure and/or promotion to associate professor.
   In the 5th year, you ask for your department chair (and possibly immediate
   supervisor if they are different people) to write a letter of support to the
   Dean of the faculty for your evaluation. If the Dean agrees you then submit
   a CV, vision statement, list of references to the Dean and the promotion
   evaluation committee. The promotion evaluation committee (loopbaan
   commissie) is comprised of full professors in the faculty and possibly some
   full professors from outside the faculty. You present your accomplishments
   and vision to them and they then ask you questions. This committee sends a
   recommendation for whether you should be kept as a permanent employee and if
   you should be promoted to associate professor. The Dean then makes a
   decision based on the advice of the committee. If you are not given a
   permanent position, you then have 1 year to find another job with some
   undefined assistance from the university. If you are granted a permanent
   contract, you may also be granted a promotion to associate professor, but
   that is an independent decision. If you are granted a permanent contract but
   not promoted to associate, then you are given advice on what to improve and
   typically a recommended time when to return to the promotion evaluation
   committee for a revaluation.
Academic Career Track
   Apparently, Dutch law does not allow temporary contracts for long durations
   so the Tenure Track process was converted to the Academic Career Track
   process in 2023. The differences are that you are given a permanent contract
   after 18 months employment with minimal assessment and the promotion
   committee only evaluates you on promotion to associate. The evaluation for
   promotion to associate now falls in the 5-8 year range and the midterm
   evaluation is about at the same time ~2.5 years. It is not entirely clear
   what happens if you are not promoted after 8 years, but it seems you will be
   moved to a non-professor career track and may not retain the assistant
   professor title.

Results
=======

Midterm committee evaluation, April 24, 2023 (7 years, 8 months as asst. prof; 2 years, 9 months @ TU Delft)
   Following the interview, it was communicated that I was right on track and
   that I should request promotion assessment when I "am on speed with
   publications from TU Delft" and acquired funding for one or two PhD
   positions. Additionally, it was suggested I have more focus when presenting
   my research, get to know the organization and way of working in Dutch
   academia better, to proactively strengthen my leadership, and to take advice
   from other Americans who have been promoted here.
Promoted to UD1 from UD2, Monday, May 1, 2023
   Passing the midterm and teaching qualification courses (which I gained
   exemption due to 5+ years teaching experience prior to TUD) cause me to be
   promoted from asst. prof 2 (UD2) to asst. prof 1 (UD1). This gave me a
   salary scale of 12, step 3.
Request to go in front of the promotion committee, Monday, May 1, 2023
   Following the midterm results, I requested to go before the promotion
   committee as soon as possible given that I had 8 years of accomplisments and
   experience as an assistant professor. My chair and supervisor agreed and
   wrote a support letter to the Dean. I met with the committee chair and the
   Dean and they agreed to let me proceed with the interview with the
   committee.
Switch to Academic Career Track, 2023
   I had the option to switch tracks and I did (sometime after the midterm) and
   signed a new permanent contract.
Promotion committee evaluation, December 11, 2023 (8 years, 3 months as asst. prof; 3 years, 4 months @ TU Delft) and Promotion decision January 22, 2024
   I was denied promotion to associate professor with the primary feedback that
   I did not follow the recommendations given to me at the midterm evaluation.
