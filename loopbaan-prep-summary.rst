Leadership
==========

I struggle to know what to write here. There is no way I could have done all
that I have without being a leader. I try to lead by example, with directness
but with compassion, hold to my promises but be honest if I fail, give freedom
and ownership of responsibilities to my teams, and to always give the due
credit to those that do the work; putting them front and center instead of
myself. I try to always put people before results; start with caring and
supporting your team and the results will follow.
